# Simplify3d (S3D) Print Logger
A first attempt to create a utilitiy that can log 3D Print jobs and all of the settings associated with each job.

Experimentation with numerous FFF process settings is often required to get quality prints of complicated parts.  Recording all relevent process settings (and other info) on a series of prints can help shed light on the complicated interactions and relationships between settings.  However this is very tedious and time consuming task.
The ability to easily record ALL process settings in a structured system would save time, give one a more complete picture of the cause and effect of individual settings.  This leads to an analytical approach that relates the quantitative data (from S3D) to the qualitative data on the physical result.

S3d adds every FFF settings at the top of gcode files that it generates.  Additionally it adds the (expected) Build Summary at the bottom of the file.  These settings can be extracted from the gcode files and added to a database for comparision or further processing and the addition of other data like the specific material used, an assessment of the printed part's quality and other notes.

## Goals
1. Create a parser that pulls the settings out of the .gcode file
2. Load the settings for the part into a database
3. Prompt the user for a set of questions/selections on the qualitative attributes of the printed parts.
4. A meta-comparitor for like parts
5. Ideally this utility would become a plugin for S3D
